# Focus Timer - Pomodoro ðŸ•“ðŸ“š

The Focus Timer - Pomodoro app is excellent for those who want to study using the pomodoro technique. It is a counter where the user enters as much time as he wants and when that time is up, 
an alarm sounds, notifying him of the end of time (it is also possible to play background music that loops while the counter is running).
